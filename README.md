# Digital-Signatures
This project explores digital signature technologies as essential cryptographic tools for securing digital communications and transactions. Digital signatures provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation services critical to modern cybersecurity frameworks. The project examines both traditional algorithms (RSA, DSA, ElGamal, and Rabin) and emerging quantum-resistant approaches like lattice-based cryptography. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate these systems against security standards, computational efficiency, and practical implementation challenges. The research highlights how digital signatures secure e-commerce, legal documentation, software distribution, and blockchain transactions. Special attention is given to vulnerabilities in current systems and how quantum computing advances threaten established cryptographic methods. We propose implementation strategies for organizations transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic solutions, particularly focusing on hybrid approaches during the transition period. The project demonstrates practical applications through prototype implementations and performance benchmarks. Our findings indicate that while RSA and DSA remain industry standards, organizations should begin adopting quantum-resistant alternatives. This work contributes to the cybersecurity field by providing a comprehensive framework for digital signature implementation across various sectors and offering a roadmap for cryptographic resilience in the quantum computing era.
